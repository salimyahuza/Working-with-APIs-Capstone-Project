# Working-with-APIs-Capstone-Project

## Weather and Air Quality Data Integration
This project demonstrates how to integrate data from multiple external APIs to analyze and visualize the relationship between weather conditions and air quality metrics. By using Python, the project fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and air quality data from the AQICN API, processes the data, and provides insights through correlation analysis and visualizations.

## Features
This project integrates real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure, and weather description) from the OpenWeatherMap API and air quality data (AQI, PM2.5, PM10, and O3 levels) from the AQICN API. The data is combined into a single DataFrame for processing, with correlation analysis performed to identify relationships between metrics. The insights are visualized through a heatmap of the correlation matrix and a bar chart comparing weather and air quality metrics.
